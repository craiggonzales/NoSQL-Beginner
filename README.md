NoSQL Beginner. Created a NoSQL Database to track my study for cyberSecurity. I named the database cyberStudy. In order to create, read, update, and delete entries in the cyberStudy database, I created a CRUD pythons script called 'studydb.py'. 

This folder includes 'studydb.py' and it incldues a dump of the most up-to-date entries in my study plan.
